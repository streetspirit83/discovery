# Discovery Workspace – Claude Code Notes

## Project Overview
Stock/ETF candidate discovery tool. Scrapes signals from multiple sources (insider buying, trend lists, ETF changes), stores them in Netlify Blob Storage, and provides a UI for review + AI enrichment.

## Architecture
- **adapters/**: Node.js 20 scrapers that push candidates to the backend
- **netlify-backend/**: Netlify serverless functions for storage + scrape proxy
- **ui/**: Plain HTML/CSS/ES Modules frontend (no build step)
- **data/**: Example data files

## Running Adapters
```bash
npm ci
node adapters/_run.js openinsider
node adapters/_run.js boerse-frankfurt
node adapters/_run.js etf-holdings
```

Requires env vars: `DISCOVERY_BACKEND_URL`, `DISCOVERY_SECRET`
Optional: `FMP_API_KEY`, `TWELVEDATA_API_KEY` (for US exchange resolution)

## UI Development
Open `ui/index.html` directly in a browser – no build step needed.
Works with mock data without any backend.
Settings → configure backend URL, secret, and Claude API key for full functionality.

## Key Design Decisions
- All storage goes through Netlify Blobs (3 blobs: inbox, archive, export)
- Dedup by symbol+exchange: inbox merges sources, archive/export skips
- AI enrichment calls Anthropic API directly from browser (requires CORS header `anthropic-dangerous-direct-browser-access: true`)
- No TypeScript, no React, no bundler – intentional simplicity

## Blob Types
- **inbox**: Active candidates being reviewed
- **archive**: Dismissed candidates (kept for dedup)
- **export**: Promoted candidates ready for action

## Workspace States
`new` → `reviewed` → `promoted` | `dismissed`

## GitHub Actions
- Adapters run on schedule (daily at 6 AM UTC)
- UI deploys to GitHub Pages on push to main

## Netlify Setup
Deploy `netlify-backend/` directory. Set environment variables:
- `DISCOVERY_SECRET` – shared secret for API auth
